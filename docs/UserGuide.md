{: .alert .alert-info}

> **:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>
>
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add /name NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add /name John Doe`.
>
>* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `edit INDEX [/name NAME] [/contact PHONE_NUMBER]` can be used as `edit 1 /name John` or as `edit 2 /contact 94567732` or as `edit /name John /contact 94567732`.
>
> * Items followed by `â€¦`â€‹ can be repeated multiple times, or not used at all.<br>
  e.g. `[/tag TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `/tag friend`, `/tag friend /tag family` etc.
>
> * Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `/name NAME /contact PHONE_NUMBER`, `/contact PHONE_NUMBER /name NAME` is also acceptable.
>
> * Any extra parameters entered for commands that donâ€™t require them (like `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
>
> * If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters around line-breaks may not transfer correctly when pasted into the application.

* `sort class` Sorts the results by class in alphanumerical order. Only the **first class** in each person's list of classes is considered when sorting.
* `sort attendance` Sorts the results by the number of days attended by students in descending order. Teachers, who do not have an attendance count, are placed at the end of the list
* Sorting is case-insensitive.

{: .alert .alert-info}
> :information_source: **Note:**
>
> Explanation on Sorting by First Item:
> When sorting by attributes such as subject or class, only the first item in the list of subjects or classes is considered. For instance:
> * If a student has subjects listed as "Math, Physics, Chemistry", the `sort subject` command will use "Math" as the primary sorting key.
> * Similarly, if a teacher is associated with classes "5A, 7C, 8B", the `sort class` command will use "5A" as the sorting key.

{: .alert .alert-warning}
> :exclamation: **Warning:**
>
> The `sort` command works on the overall list of contacts and not on a filtered list produced by the `find` command.

Examples:
* `list` followed by `sort attendance` sorts the list of students by attendance in descending order.
   <br/><br/>
   ![sort attendance command](images/SortAttendanceCommand.png)

### Undoing the last command : `undo`

Reverts the most recent change made to the address book.

Format: `undo`

* Reverts the last modification command, restoring the address book to its previous state.

* Multiple undo commands can be used consecutively to revert multiple changes, one step at a time.

{: .alert .alert-warning}
> :exclamation: **Warning:**
>
> The `undo` command only works within the current session. Once you close EduConnect, the history of changes is cleared, and you will not be able to undo any actions from previous sessions.

Examples:
* `edit 1 /name Alex Koh` followed by `undo` restores the name of the 1st person back to its original state.
* `delete 3` followed by `undo` restores the deleted student back to the list.

### Redoing the last command : `redo`

* Reapplies the last undone modification command, returning the address book to the state before the `undo`.
* Only commands that were undone can be redone.
* Multiple `redo` commands can be used consecutively to reapply multiple changes, one step at a time.

{: .alert .alert-warning}
> :exclamation: **Warning:**
>
> The `redo` command only functions in the current session. If EduConnect is closed, the action history is lost, and you will not be able to redo any previously undone actions from past sessions.

Examples:
* `edit 1 /name Alex Koh` followed by `undo` and then `redo` restores the name of the 1st person back to `Alex Koh`.

> If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, EduConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
  Furthermore, certain edits can cause the EduConnect to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: First, install EduConnect on the new computer. Then, copy the data file from your old computer and replace the empty data file in the new installation folder with your existing one. This will transfer all your previous data to the new computer.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
